For this portfolio submission, I wanted to use audio, video and video capture.
I created the background template of a camera and phone to play the media on to mae it more visually interesting.
I wanted to look into playing two videos at once, but I wasn't sure how to change the placement of the second video whilst keeping the first where it was.
