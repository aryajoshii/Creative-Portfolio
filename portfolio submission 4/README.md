For this I attempted to make a platform style catching game. I struggled to do this a bit as I ran into issues with the collisions, I wasn't able to fully fix this in time as the circle still disappears a bit earlier than I would have liked.
I also ran into an issue with this piece where the ball moves up and down slightly every time an arrow key is pressed, however I am not sure how to fix this as I couldn't identify which part of the code was causing this.
