# Creative-Portfolio

## *submission 1*
For this, I made a slightly different version of Tondo: Black and White II by Carmen Herrera. My piece, whilst inspired by this, is also different because I have added a gradient background. 
This sketch was only working some of the time when I tried to run it from VS code directly, so I have included a link to a p5.js web editor version of this sketch which is working. 

## *submission 2*
I used text from 'a Thousand Splendid Suns' by Khaled Hosseini for this. I have also imported my own font into this project. 

## *submission 3*
For this, I have made a grid that resembles flowers, and changes with every refresh of the page. 

## *submission 4*
I tried to step out of my comfort zone and make something more complicated for this submission, so I attempted making a mini game. As I was running out of time, the game does not run as smoothly as I would've liked, but I am still happy with the outcome. 

## *submission 5*
I am proud of this piece, as I had a clear idea of what I wanted to make and was able to execute this relatively successfully, with a phone and camera template. I have also used my own footage for the video element in this piece, with a 'vlog' of my day at university.
